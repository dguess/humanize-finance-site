**Mina** protocol has a unique design that enables participants to quickly synchronize to the network and verify the blockchain.

Other blockchain protocols require powerful infrastructure to run the network nodes resulting in the creation of centralized intermediaries. Mina is light-weight by design so that anyone can connect peer-to-peer and quickly synchronise and verify the blockchain. It is built using a consistent sized cryptographic proof, so even as the blockchain scales it remains accessible for all participants.

Mina's SNARK-powered decentralized apps (snapps) enable a new way for users to keep control of their own data - by validating and sharing proofs to third parties instead of the data itself. Logic and data can be computed off-chain and verified on-chain allowing snapps to scale to large computations efficiently and cost effectively.
